## Deep Feature

This code gets last Average Pooling output from each frames.  
Outputs is 2048 dimensional vectors.

## Usage

```
python main.py --input <input_dir> --output <output_dir> ( --only_hand)
```

- input_dir

Put videos this directory to extract Deep Feature

- output_dir

Outputs Deep Feature is saved files into this directory

- only_hand

If this option is true, ectract deep feature from neibor hands
